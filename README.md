# BvhToMimic

## Goal

The [DeepMimic project](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic) currently offers no way to import custom reference motions. This is shown in [DeepMimic issue #23](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic/issues/23). This project aims to transfer animation data from .BVH files into DeepMimic Motion files. Motion files can then be used to Train DeepMimic skills.
